    <h3>This link takes you to the home page of Apple. Which is a perfect example of a good wbsite layout.</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>C. Contrast: A white background with black contrasting text. Which is a great use of contrasting colors to make it easy for the user to read.
        <li>R. Repetition: repeated use of the same font, colors(black, white, and grey), and shapes(squares)
        <li>A. Alignment: All images and blocks of texts all align well together. They follow a simple alignment which seems to work effortlessly.
        <li>P. Proximity: All of the text is spaced out properly so it is easier for the user to read/navigate.
        </ul>

        <h3>This link takes you to the art page of yale.edu</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>C. Contrast: When it comes to having contrasting colors, this website does a good job. But it has too many contrasting colors. It doesn't have any sort of color pallette making it hard to look at
            <li>R. Repetition: Absolutely no repetition, there is a lot of different font styles going on like underlining and bolding in what feels like random places.
            <li>A. Alignemnt: There is no alignment at all. It seems to have a different text blocks spaced out differently for each one.
            <li>P. Proximity: Although the words for the most part are spaced out appropiately according to its border. The alternating text sizes and proximities make this website very unappealing.
