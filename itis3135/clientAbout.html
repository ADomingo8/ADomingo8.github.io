            <p>Hey, my name is Jessie Vera Rodriguez, I started my photography journey when I joined my high school yearbook class. I started taking pictures with a camera I had borrowed from my teacher. I began by taking pictures of my family and pets. My cat was tired of me making him pose but he does not pay rent, so it does not matter. I had little knowledge of how to use a camera, I would watch YouTube for hours trying to learn what every setting meant. Over a few weeks and hundreds of photos I began taking some quality photos, I started to get better when I began taking pictures at sports events at school and football games. At the end of each game, I would have photoshoots with my football teammates and friends in the student section. During those photoshoots I started to understand how lighting worked, since I took most of the pictures at night, I learned how to use the floodlights and the darkness to my advantage. I took my camera with me every time I traveled, I tried to learn how to take photos in different environments and at different times of day, I developed an eye for taking photos, I knew from what angle to take photos and how to adjust the lighting to make them look as good as possible.

            I want to continue my journey now that I've come to college, I believe offering my services would be an effective way to keep exploring photography and earning some money. Throughout this website, I have provided my schedule and contact information, as well as several images I've taken in the past with my friends. Feel free to email me any questions, I would be happy to answer them. </p>
